This file contains guidelines to GIT

COMMIT FILES
    <make sure you are in the right branch>
    git status #will tell which files are modified or not tracked
    ADDING FILES    
	git add <modified or nontracked files>
    REMOVING FILES
	git rm <files to be removed>    
    git commit -m "comment" <modified or nontracked files>
    git push origin yourBranchName

GET CHANGES FROM BRANCH
    git pull origin yourBranchName

CREATE BRANCH
    git branch yourBranchName
    git checkout yourBranchName

MERGE BRANCH TO MASTER (MASTER IS AHEAD OF YOUR BRANCH)
    git checkout yourBranchName
    git rebase master
    (if merge conflicts occur do following)
        <solve merge conflicts>
	    (often you can just delete conflicts from conflicted files)
        git add <conflicted files>
    git rebase --continue
    git checkout master
    git merge yourBranchName
    git push origin master

MERGE BRANCH TO MASTER (YOUR BRANCH IS AHEAD OF MASTER)
    git checkout master
    git merge yourBranchName
    git push origin master

DELETE BRANCH
    git branch -d yourBranchName #deletes your local branch
    git push origin --delete yourBranchName #deletes remote branch (GITHub)

USEFULL COMANDS
    git merge --abort #aborts the merge (usefull if there are merge conflicts)
