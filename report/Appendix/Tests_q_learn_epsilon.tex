\subsection{The impact of $\epsilon$ on Q-learning performance}
The purpose of this test is to show how different values of $\epsilon$ influences the performance of Q-learning.
\subsubsection{Description of test}
This test was done by performing 100 trials of each selected value of $\epsilon$ for a range of episodes. The test was conducted using the world "5-room world" seen on figure \ref{fig:5_room_world}.\\
The distance punishments are bases on those found in the test in appendix \ref{subsec:est_path_length}. The distance punishments was scaled with a factor of 1.2 to make the distance a bigger factor in final path.\\
The probabilities used for each room was found in the test in appendix \ref{subsec:probability_test}. These probabilities was divided by the maximal value and scaled by a factor of 20. This was done to ensure that the total reward for entering a room the first time would be positive.\par 
The initial state for all tests was set to room 3 in order to ensure greatest number of possible paths.
