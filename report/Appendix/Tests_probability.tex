\subsection{Room based probability of marbles spawning}
The purpose of this test is to determine the probability of a marble spawning in each of the 14 rooms described in section \ref{subsec:design_environment}.\par 
This is done by conduction 50 tests, where the position of each of the 20 marbles in the Gazebo environment are saved resulting in a total of 1000 samples.\par 
Using the class \texttt{map\_class} the position of the marbles are mapped from gazebo coordinates to pixel positions in the map. That is then used to determine in which room the marbles spawned.
