\subsection{Environment}
The two-wheeled robot should navigate around in the environment called “bigworld” shown on figure {\color{red} xx}. To do so more effectively, we have chosen to divide the world into 14 rooms and each of these rooms has been given a room number. This division is illustrated on figure {\color{red} yy} using a gray scale, where each room has been given a specific gray tone color.
