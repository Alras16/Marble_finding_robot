\label{subsec:design_environment}
The two-wheeled robot should navigate around the environment called bigworld shown in figure (\ref{fig:bigworld_white}). To do so, it have been chosen to divide the environment into rooms. The natural definition of \textit{'rooms'} have been taken into account, resulting in a 14 room layout. This can be seen in figure (\ref{fig:bigworld_14_rooms}), where each room can be distinguished by different grey scale colours. 
\subfile{../Figures/Environment}
The division into rooms are useful in terms of knowing which rooms that have been searched and which that not yet have been searched for marbles.\\
It is also useful as an abstract state space for reinforcement learning such that it can be found which order the rooms  should be visited.
