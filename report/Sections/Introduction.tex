\subsection{Problem statement}
\subsubsection{Problems}
The following problems are stated to better describe the focus points throughout the project.\todo{XXXX}
\begin{enumerate}
        \item How can an algorithm, which can find marbles in a closed map, be designed?
        \item How can this algorithm be optimized, so the robot can find the ball faster, based on previous trails? 
        \item How can marbles and obstacles be detected from lidar data?
        \item How can marbles and obstacles be detected from camera data?
        \item How can a Fuzzy-control algorithm be constructed?
        \item How can computer vision be used to detect marbles and obstacles, and to construct the map? \todo[inline]{XXXX}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Limitations}
The robot must be able to find marbles in a closed map and optimize itself based on previous trails. Thus the following limitations to the algorithms is listed: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To detect marbles and obstacles.
    \item To construct a map.
    \item To optimize for the shortest distance and time.
\end{enumerate}
QT Creator, Fuzzy Lite, Gazebo and Matlab will be used throughout the project.
