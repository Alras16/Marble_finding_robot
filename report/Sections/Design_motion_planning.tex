\subsection{Motion planning}

Two motion planers are going to be used as motion planning for the robot. As the sensor based planer a tangent bug algorithm will be used. The reason for choosing this algorithm is the effectiveness of the tangent bug which only needs an initial position and target location. A number of algorithms will be taken into consideration of the model based planner for generating a road map. Both motion planners will use fuzzy logic for robot control. The fuzzy controller will be discussed in \ref{subsec:searhStrategy} and \ref{subsec:searhStrategyImplementation}.
