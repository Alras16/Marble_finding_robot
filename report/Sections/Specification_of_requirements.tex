\subsection{Specification of requirements}

From the outline of the project as well as the problem statement, the following requirements to the robot have been formulated:

\begin{itemize}

\item[-] The robot must be able to detect blue colours in an image so that blue marbles will be detected and collected by the robot.
\item[-] To insure a safe working space for the robot to operate, a minimum distance of 0.2 meters to obstacles must be respected.
\item[-] To be able to collect as many marbles as possible, the robot must be capable of finding all areas in a closed environment. 
\item[-] It must be able to optimise its current path and find an optimal path with minimal numbers of unrewarded moves.  
\item[-] The robot must be able to distinguish obstacles from marbles as well as localising the position of the marbles.      

\end{itemize}
