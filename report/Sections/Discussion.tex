\section{Discussion}

The reason the line detection algorithm was not used, was that the marble detection algorithm was not properly performing at times. This means that the merging part of the line detecting algorithm would merge lines that should not have been merged. Threshold on the angle between two lines could prevent this behaviour to some extent if this threshold was tuned. The main issue was the falsely detected marbles. This was due to the marble detection algorithm tendering to detect marbles in corners. This could have been prevented by detecting how good the points fitted the found circle and by setting a threshold on the radius off the circle. 
Due to time constrains the motion planning was not coupled together with q-learning. If this had been the case, the robot would have been able to search for marbles in rooms in the most optimized way from reinforcement learning.
