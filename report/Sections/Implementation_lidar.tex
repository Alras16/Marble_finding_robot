\subsection{Lidar}
The implementation of the line and marble detection is done by designing a class called \texttt{lidar\_sensor} containing the key methods: \texttt{find\_marbles()}, \texttt{find\_lines()} and \texttt{merge\_lines()}. The first two key methods detect the marbles and lines in the image respectively. The third key method merges the lines on either side of a marble. The following two section describes the key methods in detail.
