\subsection{Lidar}
The marble and line detection was implemented by designing a class containing functionalities such as determining and holding detecting marbles and lines, and merging these lines. This class was named \texttt{lidar\_sensor}. 

The output from these methods are visualised using opencv functions \texttt{cv::line()} and \texttt{cv::circle()}.
